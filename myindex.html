<!-- ### Instructions

1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `HW-Wireframe`.
2. Clone this repository to your computer by following the process we went over in class.
3. Navigate to the `HW-Wireframe` folder you just cloned onto your machine. Then create two files inside this folder: `index.html` and `style.css`.
4. Make your initial Git commit and push it to GitHub.
   * `git add .`
   * `git commit -m "<COMMENT>"`
   * `git push origin master`
   * If this process was done correctly, you should see these two files appear in your repository. This will be your initial test to confirm that you're hooked into GitHub.
5. Return to your local copies of `index.html` and `style.css`. Using the screenshot at the top of these instructions, recreate the design using HTML/CSS.
   * All of your HTML should be inside of the `index.html` file.
   * All of your CSS should be inside of the `style.css` file.
6. When you finish the assignment, commit your changes with Git and push them into your GitHub repo. Remember:
   * `git add .`
   * `git commit -m "<COMMENT>"`
   * `git push origin master`

### Helpful Hints

* For a refresher on working with Git and GitHub, consult the GitHub Supplemental Guide we sent you in class.
* Don't forget to review these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.
* This will be a tough assignment. Towards the end of the course, you'll look back to this exercise and realize just how much you've grown as a developer. Stay positive!

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit the link to the Github Repository!

                                        <p>Welcome to my portfolio!
                                                This is a space where I introduce myself to potential collaborators, employers, and anyone who wants to connect about coding.
                                                
                                                For the last few years I calculated quantum numbers, synthesized chemicals, TAed, and took classes like physical chemistry.
                                                After a while I realized that among my diverse interests, coding is the common demonator. So I started the Georgia Tech Full Stack Bootcamp in 2019.
                                                
                                                Random Fact 1 - I'm an Atlanta Peach! The city always felt like my home even though I lived abroad when I was younger.
                                                
                                                RF 2 - I always think about designs and am sporatically sketching in my dark room. 
                                                
                                                RF 3 - In a few years, I want to get invovled with cybersecurity, brain-computer interface, and blockchain.
