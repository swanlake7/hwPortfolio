                    Welcome to my portfolio!
                        This is a space where I introduce myself to potential collaborators, employers, and anyone who wants to connect about coding.
            
                        For the last few years I calculated quantum numbers, synthesized chemicals, TAed, and took classes like physical chemistry.
                        After a while I realized that among my diverse interests, coding is the common demonator. So I started the Georgia Tech Full Stack Bootcamp in 2019.

                        Random Fact 1 - I'm an Atlanta Peach! The city always felt like my home even though I lived abroad when I was younger.

                        RF 2 - I always think about designs and am sporatically sketching in my dark room.

                        RF 3 - In a few years, I want to get invovled with cybersecurity, brain-computer interface, and blockchain.
